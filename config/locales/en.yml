# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      info:  "When you travel to a foreign country you convert your currency to the local currency. The stronger your home currency is relative to the foreign currency the better the bargain. To forecast your purchasing power abroad you need to look at the change in the exchange rate, the average cost of a standardized product (like the Big Mac), and the cost of living."

    body1_html:  "<li>Tourist exchange rates change when demand for a currency goes up or down. These fluctuations are continuous and happen for a number of reasons.</li><li>Increased business activity in a country can strengthen its currency, as can high interest rates or low inflation rates. The impact of higher interest rates is mitigated if inflation in the country is much higher than in others.</li><li>Price variations within a country should also be taken into account when considering where to travel. Stuff costs more in big urban cities than it does in small rural towns.</li>"

    body2_html:  "<li>Check with your bank and ask them about any transaction fees for using your card abroad. You will often get the best rates this way but not every case is the same.</li><li>If your bank charges steep fees for purchases and withdrawals made with your card abroad then you may want to consider using a travel money service.</li><li>In general, currency exchange counters at airports, stations and hotels – although convenient – offer the worst tourist exchange rates. However, vendors outside of these travel hubs are another good option.</li>"
